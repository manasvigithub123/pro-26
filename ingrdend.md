Ingredients
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups sugar
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon espresso powder homemade or store-bought
1 cup milk buttermilk, almond, or coconut milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil canola oil, or melted coconut oil
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup boiling water
Chocolate Buttercream Frosting Recipe
Instructions

Preheat oven to 350º F. Prepare two 9-inch cake pans by spraying with baking spray or buttering and lightly flouring.
For the chocolate cake:
Add flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, salt and espresso powder to a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk through to combine or, using your paddle attachment, stir through flour mixture until combined well.
Add milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla to flour mixture and mix together on medium speed until well combined. Reduce speed and carefully add boiling water to the cake batter until well combined.
Distribute cake batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until a toothpick or cake tester inserted in the center of the chocolate cake comes out clean.
Remove from the oven and allow to cool for about 10 minutes, remove from the pan and cool completely.
Frost cake with Chocolate Buttercream Frosting.
Notes
The cake batter will be very thin after adding the boiling water. This is correct and results in the most delicious and moist chocolate cake I’ve ever tasted! xo
Freezer Friendly
Let the baked cake layers cool completely. Wrap them well with plastic wrap and then with foil. Put each layer into a freezer bag and freeze up to 2 months. To serve, thaw in the refrigerator overnight with wrapping intact. The next day, the layers are ready to fill and frost.

Here are a few additional ways I like to make this cake!

Chocolate Cupcakes

If you are looking for cupcakes from this recipe, I’ve shared my recipe for the best chocolate cupcakes with vanilla buttercream frosting for ya. This recipe makes a perfect dozen so that you can scale the recipe to make as many chocolate cupcakes as you need! Talk about easy! 🙂

9×13 Chocolate Cake

I love this version! It is a delicious, scaled-down version that is just the thing for potlucks, reunions, tailgates, and travels perfectly! I’ve also scaled-down the frosting so that has the frosting to cake ratio that my family prefers. It is a definite winner!

Large Chocolate Sheet Cake

Scaled for a crowd, this recipe bakes beautifully in a rimmed baking sheet and is perfect for all sorts of get-togethers. Think of it as the 9×13’s big brother! 🙂 This recipe features Fudge Icing, but you can definitely substitute the icing for whatever you fancy!

And there you have it. There are so many ways to enjoy this delicious cake. Practically one for whatever need you might have. But, if I’ve missed one, be sure to let me know and I’ll work on it for you! 🙂

PS – Many of you have asked me if there is a way to make a Vanilla Cake Recipe that is just as delicious as this chocolate. Well friends, I’ve tested and tested and tested and now can proudly say – YES! It is definitely the best Vanilla Cake I’ve ever tasted, too! 🙂

Enjoy!

Sooo good! This has been our go-to cake for special occasions for the last couple of years now, and it’s always a crowd pleaser. I recently made the 9×13 version in an 8×8 pan (added 5 mins to baking time) with vanilla buttercream frosting (halved), and it was the perfect size for our family of 4. My son has requested chocolate cupcakes with peanut butter frosting for his birthday, so that’s next! 😊

Hands down THE best chocolate cake recipe. I made this for my daughters birthday and have received so many compliments – and requests for the recipe. It was very easy to make… a great one to make with little ones. I have eaten lots of cake over the years (I like cake!) and this has to be the most delicious, moist chocolate cake I have every tasted. The only down side – it doesn’t last long!

Janice, I’m not sure why your cake would be dry. This is a very moist cake. Some reasons a cake can be dry are the cake baked too long, the oven is heating to a higher degree than it should, or ingredients were not room temperature.

Hi Robyn. I’m new to baking but super excited to make this cake in a few days! Questions though, I have (2) 8″x3″ baking pans. Should i use all the batter still or will the layers be too tall to stack? Would it be better if I made the recipe using your converter for less servings, say 18 instead of 24?

Thanks so much in advance if you have time to answer!

REPLY
Robyn Stone
November 3, 2020 at 12:33 am
Leah, I think the 3-inch cakes should be fine to stack. You should be able to make this recipe in your 2 8″x3″ pans. Since these layers will be thicker, it will take longer to bake, about 55-60 minutes.

Thank you so much for this recipe it worked amazingly well and you couldn’t tell it was gluten free at all.

I have a friend who would like me to make her the same cake but with Erythritol instead of sugar. Would this be an equal substitute to normal sugar? Also if I powdered it to make the base for the buttercream?
Thank you!

I have been making this chocolate cake for years and it is the best chocolate cake ever. All of my friends and family love it.
This last weekend, I upped the game on this cake and you might want to try it for a change.
I left the espresso out.
When I measured my sugar I used one 3 oz pack of cherry jello and then added the sugar to make 2 cups. Used the rest of the recipe as usual.
My husband was convinced it wouldn’t bake right but it came out beautifully.
This made an outstanding cherry fudge cake.
Used the usual chocolate buttercream frosting but also put cherry pie filling in between the layers and on top.
Wish I could include a picture because it was beautiful and great.
4 people, one cake gone in one night!
Try it.

I used 3 6 inch cake tins and divided evenly. I baked for about 42/43 minutes and they came out great. I think I went through all 10,000 comments looking for some answers on this for 6in and didn’t find much so thought it would be helpful to share for those inquiring!

I always claim I don’t like chocolate cake, so when my son asked for one for his birthday I didn’t have any tried and true recipes. If you’re tired of dry chocolate cake with sickly sweet frosting, try this recipe! It really did have everyone at the table raving – even me! It’s dark, thick, fudgy, and rich without being sickly. It was really a breeze to make, too! Writing this one down for future celebrations!

Liz, I use Hershey’s Natural Unsweetened Cocoa Powder. I haven’t made this in 4-inch pans but I think you should bake a 4-inch x 2-inch cake in about 20 minutes. If you don’t want the added caffeine from the espresso powder for her cake, you can omit it. I hope your daughter enjoys her cake.

The layers would be really thin, Maria, if you divide it into 3 9-inch pans. If you want 3 layers, I would advise making one recipe for 2 pans and then making half the recipe for the third.

I’ve made this cake a few years ago and recently have a chance to make this again! It was delicious the first time.

I can’t remember what I used the first time, but does it matter what cocoa powder I use? Dutch processed or natural? I recently learnt there was a difference so wanted to make sure I don’t affect the cake by using the wrong one.
